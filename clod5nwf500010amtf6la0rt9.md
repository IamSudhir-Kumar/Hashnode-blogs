## **Introduction**

Hacktoberfest 2023 has concluded, and I'm thrilled to share my experiences during this remarkable month-long celebration of open-source contributions.

## **Embarking on the Journey**

My initiation into Hacktoberfest began with the discovery of this event through a YouTube video in late September. With aspirations to make meaningful contributions to open source projects, I soon realized that the key challenge for newcomers is finding issues labelled as 'good first issue' or 'Hacktoberfest.'

### **Navigating New Rules**

The 10th year of Hacktoberfest brought about some notable changes. Farewell to the coveted t-shirts, and welcome digital reward kits. Moreover, for the fortunate early birds, a tree would be planted in their name via Tree Nation - an environmentally conscious gesture.

### **Accomplishments and Recognition**

With only four PRs, I achieved success. This journey not only rewarded me with a sense of accomplishment but also earned me digital badges to acknowledge my contributions.

### **Tech Stack Exploration**

My initial PR found a home in a college coding society's open-source project. I created a dedicated web page highlighting web development tech stacks, which was well-received by the maintainers.

### **Insights and Appreciation**

A subsequent PR in the same repository delved into key insights about the tech stacks. My rapid response, followed by a LinkedIn message expressing gratitude, helped build a positive connection with the maintainers.

### **The Rollercoaster Ride**

Submitting a total of eight PRs, I faced the bitter reality that not all would be accepted. While some were deemed unproductive, my first PR was accepted during the second week of October after an anxious six-day wait for evaluation.

### **Unexpected Challenges**

My third PR, concerning an outdated fork ts checker in a UI library repository, brought unexpected hurdles. The introduction of 'pre-commit husky' complicated matters, resulting in a sleepless night. Nevertheless, I emerged with newfound knowledge and a deeper connection with the repository's maintainers.

**The E-commerce Framework Challenge:** My fourth PR involved re-configuring the layout section of an e-commerce framework, integrating Laravel and Vue.js. Despite having to brush up on PHP basics, I successfully resolved the issue after ten hours of rigorous effort.

**The Everlasting Commitment:** In conclusion, open source isn't a fleeting endeavour. It's a perpetual aspect of a developer's journey. As developers, we bear the collective responsibility to enhance software for the greater good. While Hacktoberfest provides a fantastic entry point for open-source enthusiasts, it's vital to recognize that the journey extends beyond a single month.

### **Closing Thoughts**

Joining the Hacktoberfest movement is more than just coding; it's about forging connections and making your mark in the open-source realm. Don't wait â€“ begin your journey now.
